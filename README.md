# FlPlatform

Angular 18 standalone application for running experiments, configuring algorithms, and reviewing results. It integrates with a backend over `/services` (proxied in dev) and uses Keycloak for authentication.

## Highlights
- **Experiment Studio** (`src/app/pages/experiment-studio`): select data models/datasets, pick variables and filters (QueryBuilder), configure algorithms, run jobs, view charts/tables.
- **Experiments Dashboard** (`src/app/pages/experiments-dashboard`): list/search/paginate, share links, compare results side by side, export to PDF.
- **Auth**: Keycloak-based session via `/services/activeUser`; guard protects routes and redirects to login if unauthenticated.

## Requirements
- Node 20+ and npm 10+
- Backend reachable at `http://localhost:8080/services` (adjustable in proxy/Docker env).
- Keycloak endpoints exposed at `/services/oauth2/authorization/keycloak` and `/services/logout`.

## Quick Start (dev)
1) Install dependencies: `npm ci`
2) Start dev server with proxy: `npm start`
   - Serves at `http://localhost:4200/`
   - Proxies `/services` to `http://localhost:8080` via `src/proxy.conf.json`
3) Ensure backend is running and you can authenticate with Keycloak.

## Scripts
- `npm start` – dev server (`ng serve`) with proxy.
- `npm run build` – production build to `dist/fl-platform`.
- `npm run watch` – development build in watch mode.
- `npm test` – unit tests via Karma.

## Backend Endpoints (expected)
- `GET /services/activeUser` – current user/session.
- `GET /services/algorithms` – algorithm catalog.
- `GET /services/data-models` – available data models (used to build variable tree and datasets).
- `POST /services/experiments` – run experiment (polls for results).
- `POST /services/experiments/transient` – quick previews (histograms, descriptive stats).
- `GET /services/experiments/:id` – fetch experiment (and results).
- `PATCH /services/experiments/:id` – update name/description/shared flag.
- `DELETE /services/experiments/:id` – delete experiment.

## Auth Flow
- Routes are guarded (`AuthGuard` in `src/app/guards/auth.guard.ts`).
- Login redirects to `/services/oauth2/authorization/keycloak?frontend_redirect=<current or target>`.
- Logout calls `/services/logout` then returns to dashboard.

## Project Structure
- `src/main.ts` – bootstraps app with router, HTTP client, credentials interceptor, ECharts.
- `src/app/app.component.*` – shell with header/footer.
- `src/app/services/` – auth/session/error handling, experiment studio orchestration, dashboard data, PDF export, label resolver, HTTP interceptor.
- `src/app/models/` – experiment, algorithm, data-model, filters, user interfaces.
- `src/app/core/algorithm-mappers.ts` – backend → UI algorithm config and output schemas.
- `src/app/pages/experiment-studio/` – variables panel, filter modal, algorithm panel, visualisations (charts/histograms/bubble).
- `src/app/pages/experiments-dashboard/` – list/search, detail, compare, mapper.
- `src/app/pages/account-page/` – basic profile view.
- `src/app/pages/shared/` – header/footer/navbar/accordion/spinner utilities.
- `src/styles.css` – global styles and QueryBuilder theming; assets in `src/assets/`.
- `Dockerfile` / `nginx.conf.template` – container build and runtime proxy (`PORTAL_BACKEND_SERVER`, `PORTAL_BACKEND_CONTEXT` envs).

## Docker
Build and serve with nginx:
```bash
docker build -t fl-platform .
docker run -e PORTAL_BACKEND_SERVER=portalbackend:8080 -e PORTAL_BACKEND_CONTEXT=services -p 80:80 fl-platform
```
Nginx proxies `/${PORTAL_BACKEND_CONTEXT}/` to the backend; everything else serves the Angular app.

## Testing
- Unit: `npm test` (Karma).
- Manual: run `npm start`, authenticate, and exercise Experiment Studio and Dashboard against a running backend.

## Notes
- Many features require authenticated backend access; unauthenticated calls will trigger login redirect.
- Algorithm availability depends on selected variables/datasets; some algorithms are transient-only (`multiple_histograms`, `descriptive_stats`).
